# CS520 Theory of Programming Languages, Fall 2019, KAIST 

This is a webpage of the course "CS520 Theory of Programming Languages", which is offered at the KAIST CS department in the fall of 2019. The webpage will contain links to course-related materials and announcements.

CS520 is an advanced graduate-level course on the theories of programming languages. Its goal is to expose students to rigorous mathematical foundations for programming languages and systems, and mathematical techniques for formally reasoning about  programs written in those languages. The course will largely follow Reynolds's textbook "Theories of Programming Languages", which provides good mathematical treatment of a wide range of programming constructs through axiomatic, denotational and operational semantics. 

The prerequisite of the course is CS320, the undergraduate-level programming-language course offered at KAIST, or a similar course. The course will be heavy in math, and we expect students to be comfortable with doing and reading rigorous mathematical proofs. 

## 1. Important Announcements

#### [1 December] The due date for the second critical review is approaching.

As announced in the beginning of this course, the deadline for the second critical review is the midnight of the 9th of December in 2019 (Monday). To write a sensible review, you will have to study not a small amount of materials. So, make sure that you start this assignment early enough.

#### [1 December] [Homework5](https://github.com/hongseok-yang/graduatePL19/blob/master/Homework/Homework5/homework5-questions.pdf) is out.

You don't have to submit your answers. In fact, even if you submit something, we won't mark it. But I strongly recommend you to try the questions in the homework, at least before the final exam.

#### [27 October] The due date for the first critical review is approaching.

The due date for the first critical review is the midnight on 1 November 2019 (Friday). Your review should be three pages or less. Make sure that you submit something even if your write-up is not as good as you want. As usual, you can submit your review in the CS520 homework submission box in the third floor of the E3-1 building, or electronically via KLMS.

## 5. Studying Materials

We will mainly follow Reynolds's book, but study the materials appearing in Chapters 8 and 10 of Tennent's book.

* Main Textbook 1 : [Theories of Programming Languages, John C Reynolds](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/theories-of-programming-languages/19530A88F3471B2A7D9891770B21DAF9), Cambridge University Press, 1998. 
* Main Textbook 2 : Semantics of Programming Languages, Robert D. Tennent, Prentice Hall, 1991. Chapters 8 and 10 only.

In addition to the two books above, the following books will have further information about the topics covered in the course. In particular, Gunter's book goes deep into the domain theory, and Pierce's book into the type theory.

* Auxiliary Textbook 1 : Semantics of Programming Languages: Structures and Techniques, Carl A. Gunter, MIT Press, 1992.
* Auxiliary Textbook 2 : Types and Programming Languages, Benjamin C. Pierce, MIT Press, 2002.
* Auxiliary Textbook 3 : Formal Semantics of Programming Languages: an Introduction, Glynn Winskel, MIT Press, 1993.

The following classic papers or their recent reprints contain deep insight into some of topics that we study throughout the course.

* John C. Reynolds, [Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order Programming Languages](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1010027404223), Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation, 1998. 
* Luis Damas and Robin Milner, [Principal Type-Schemes for Functional Programs](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=582176), POPL 1982.

## 5. Two Critical Reviews

One important part of this course is to study assigned reading materials and write reviews about them. It accounts for the 30% of the total marks of this course. In order to get full marks, a student has to show in his or her write-up that she or he has thought hard about the materials and gone beyond the simple understanding of them. Here are the details of this assignments.

1. There are two assignments for this critical review.
2. First assignment: 
   1. Topic: Shared-variable concurrency.
   2. Deadline: __**midnight of the 1st of November in 2019 (Friday).**__
   3. Reading material: Chapter 8 of Reynolds's ''Theories of Programming Languagues.'' This chapter is about shared-variable concurrency. To understand the chapter, you may have to know some materials in Chapter 7, which is about nondeterminism and guarded commands.
3. Second assignment.
   1. Topic: ML type inference. 
   2. Deadline: __**midnight of the 9th of December in 2019 (Monday).**__
   3. References:

An extended version of the paper and a prototype implementation are available [here](http://cristal.inria.fr/attapl/).
4. A review should have three pages or less.
